Predictive element of vs .....emmet
CDN?? Content Delivery Networks : places where content is hosted and we can just add the required resources 
Crossorigin??
React is a Javascript library
DOM: DOcument object model 
Interactive/ dynamic web page is the most costly operation =>> DOM tree gets changed >> Hence the DOM manipulation techniques using JS by React 

const headin = React.createElement("h3", {}, "Hello World VIA REACT");
{} : is where you would give attributes to your tag h3
headin returns a react element i.e an JavaScript object.
"Hello World VIA REACT" is the children passed to h3
React.createElement>> a JS object >> that the browser understands (html understands)>> during the render
Siblings = array of objects

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>


<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<script src="./App.js"></script>

The order of these files is permanent , if you change the alignment then React will throw error. "React not found/ defined error"



Say we already have an element present in the <div> specified in nest.render(), then when we run the code, it'll get replaced by whatever is there in nest.render()

React works whereever it is being used/called, can be the whole app or just a small part in the html like header/ footer/ aside etc

Library Vs Framework??
